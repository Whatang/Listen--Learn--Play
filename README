Listen, Learn, Play is a lightweight music player intended for use by
musicians to help them learn how to play a piece of music, or to assist with
transcription.

Vision
======

When trying to learn a piece of music, it is often necessary to repeat the
same passage multiple times. Many software and hardware music players make this 
operation possible, but to do so is fiddly and involved, making life difficult
for a musician holding an instrument.

LLP is designed to make it easy to navigate around a piece of music, to repeat 
passages, or jump to important points. This can be achieved through using the
keyboard, or by using a MIDI input device. The many cheap MIDI control surfaces 
available make controlling playback simple and convenient for a musician using
an instrument.

Status
======

LLP is now a working audio player, with the functionality required to play
back music under the user's control. All the basic operations that are needed
to make it easy to practice a piece of music repeatedly are accessible with
the mouse and with keyboard shortcuts.

LLP incorporates MIDI control so that a control surface can be used to give 
the user convenient access to LLP's functionality.

LLP seems to have a few minor bugs in it, especially obvious when running
on Linux.

About
=====

I'm a drummer. I got frustrated with having to put the sticks down and fiddle 
with my ipod every 10 seconds when trying to learn difficult fills.

LLP is written in Python using PyQt4 and Phonon to provide the graphical and
audio capabilities. pygame is used to access MIDI inputs.
